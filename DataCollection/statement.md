# Assignment 1: Personal Data Vis
Data surrounds us in our everyday life. You are producing data unconsciously through browsing histories, GPS traces, app usage logs, purchase histories, or biometric traces - but also consciously through activity logging, photo taking, social media interactions, etc.
This data has tremendous potential to help us understand our behavior and perhaps personality better. 
This assignment is meant to raise awareness of the data around and about you, help you reflect on your data needs, and help you practice some basic visual analytics skills. 
## Step 1: Choose a dataset
Choose a dataset that represents data you produce(d) in your daily life.

Examples include:
- App usage logs, browsing history, GPS traces, purchase records, communication logs, or fitness data
- Activity tracking data (e.g., sleep, steps, productivity)
- Metadata from media you produce (e.g., photos, music listening history, notes)
You may also produce hybrid datasets, where you combine your data with public data (e.g. weather information). 

Your dataset must:
- Contain at least 5 attributes (columns) of at least two different types
- Contain at least 100 records (rows)
- Be meaningful to you personally

If your dataset is larger than 100 MB, sample or filter it (e.g., use only metadata).
If you have a dataset you are interested in but you fear that it may be too small, please reach out to me (petra.isenberg@inria.fr). 

## Step 2: Reflection about the dataset
Spend a day or two monitoring yourself and how you relate to the data you are interested in. What kind of questions did come up during the day about the data? 
What 


## Step 3: Collect the dataset
Export data from a source you control (e.g., your fitness tracker or browser history). 

You may anonymize or aggregate data before submission.You can always still work with the full data for yourself later. You are NOT required to share any private, identifying, or sensitive data. In fact you may: 
- Work with synthetic or anonymized versions of your data
- Use a partial sample (e.g., one week of activity instead of a full year)
- Create a “proxy” dataset that mimics your real data structure (e.g., simulated browsing times or fitness logs based on the characteristics of your original data)

You decide what level of personal disclosure feels appropriate. The assignment will be graded on the quality of your reflection and structure, not on how revealing the data is.
Note, however, that the data has to be ethically collected (i.e., you own or have consent to use the data)

## Step 4: Describe and Reflect
Write a 1–2 page report summarizing:
- Dataset overview — Describe your dataset’s structure, size, and attributes (no need to reveal specific content).
- Motivation — Why did you choose this type of dataset? What questions do you have about this dataset? What do you want to learn from it? Produce at least 5 questions.
- Data collection process — How did you acquire, clean, or anonymize it?
- Next steps — What aspects of the data are you interested in exploring first? Note that this question is different from the second in that here you need to more concretely refer to the dataset and which aspects of it might help you answer your questions. 

## Final Deliverable
A csv file of your dataset (or the first 100 rows if it is a large one)
A pdf export of your report. The report should have the following sections in this order:
Dataset description
What is the data about
Column names and data types & data size
Data relevance
Describe why the data is relevant to you.
